# AWSRT
collection of scripts and input files to run the SWMF software
in real time on the AWS cluster
=================================
Make a new SWMF directory on AWS cluster and adapt it for
real time simulation.

Use gitclone script in /data/ANY_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION/share/Scripts/gitclone,
where ANY_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION is any SWMF distribution on the AWS cluster.
If not available, use the short version of this script:
----------------------gitclone------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl -s

my $Help = ($h or $help);
my $Sleep = ($s or $sleep);
my $History = $history;

use strict;

my $swmf_software     = "git\@github.com:SWMFsoftware";

# The project name should be all capitalized.
my %url = (
    "BATSRUS.JL"         => "https://github.com/henry2004y",
    "GITM"               => "git\@github.com:GITMCode",
    "MGITM"              => "git\@github.com:dpawlows",
    "VAC"                => "https://github.com/gtoth-umich",
    "VISANAMATLAB"       => "https://github.com/henry2004y",
    "ESMF"               => "https://github.com/esmf-org",
    "IPE"                => "git\@github.com:sword-swx-coe",
    "COMIO"              => "git\@github.com:NOAA-SWPC"
    );

my @repo = ("SWMF, AMPS, BATSRUS, CIMI, FSAM, FLEKS, GITM2, MGITM, MFLAMPA, PWOM ...", 
            sort keys %url);

my $project = $ARGV[0]; $project =~ s/\.git$//;

my $url = ($url{uc($project)} or $swmf_software);

$ARGV[0] .= " --depth 1 --no-single-branch"

my $command = "git clone $url/".join(" ", @ARGV);

print "$command\n";
`$command`;

exit 0;

To clone SWMF from github, in /data/folder do

ANY_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION/share/Scripts/gitclone SWMF NEW_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION
cd NEW_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION
./Config.pl -install
share/Scripts/gitclone AWSRT
cp AWSRT/*.sh .
=======NEW_SWMF_DISTRIBUTION is ready for real-time simulation=========

===========
Install or re-install SWMF code
May only be done when the real-time simulation does not run
(before installing, the newest version may be pulled from repository:
share/Scripts/gitall pull):

./install_AWSOM_RT_on_AWS.sh
========== SWMF is now installed or reinstalled=======================

==========
1. Start real-time simulation (from scratch or after interruption for
   more than 36 hours).

sbathch --wait -p ondemand job_sub.sh

The directory run_realtime is created (current directory run_realtime is
removed and its content is lost). Steady-state solar atmosphere is modeled
corresponing to the latest magnetogram

2. Restart real-time simulation (applied after start real-time simulation -
   see item 1 - or after more than two hours interruption in continuous
   simulation). Stops after the simulation with the latest magnetogram
   finishes before the next magnetogram is available).

sbathch --wait -p ondemand job_restart.sh

3. Recurrent real-time simulation. Continuously gets 7*24 new hourly
   magnetograms, advances the boundary condition for the solar magnetic
   field and advances the state of solar atmosphere matching this boundary
   condition

sbathch --wait -p ondemand job_recurrent.sh
=============== Simulation starts/restarts=====

=============
!!!!To stop simulation!!!!

touch run_realtime/AWSOMRT.STOP

Reaction time may be ap to an hour (for job_recurrent.sh) or a few hours
(for job_restart.sh).
